# AIQ-X Professional Suite

**AIQ-X** is an advanced benchmarking and diagnostic framework designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple dimensions of reasoning, precision, and reliability. It goes beyond surface-level accuracy to provide actionable insights for both model developers and decision makers.

## 🎯 What’s New in v4.0

- **Multi-Tier Testing**  
  Choose between **Basic (10 questions)**, **Advanced (25 questions)**, or **Expert (40+ questions)** evaluation suites.

- **Professional Diagnostics**  
  In-depth analysis that highlights specific strengths and weaknesses rather than just aggregate scores.

- **Adaptive Testing**  
  Question paths dynamically probe deeper based on real-time performance patterns.

- **Actionable Insights**  
  Clear guidance tailored for both model trainers and end users.

## 📊 Test Tiers Explained

| Tier     | Questions | Duration   | Best For |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Basic    | 10        | 2–5 mins   | Quick comparisons and core capability checks |
| Advanced | 25        | 5–10 mins  | Identifying common failure modes and depth analysis |
| Expert   | 40+       | 10–20 mins | Stress tests, adversarial examples, and boundary cases |

**Recommendation:**  
Start with the **Basic** tier to establish a baseline, then escalate to **Advanced** or **Expert** for more rigorous evaluation.

## 🔬 For Model Trainers & Researchers

The **Diagnostics** view identifies recurring failure patterns to support iterative model improvement, including:

- **Consistency Issues**  
  Variance in responses across semantically similar prompts.

- **Overconfidence Markers**  
  Use of absolute or definitive language in uncertain contexts.

- **Instruction Following Failures**  
  Inability to adhere to explicit formatting rules or constraints.

- **Reasoning Gaps**  
  Logical inconsistencies within multi-step or dependent problems.

Reports include targeted suggestions for:
- Training data refinement  
- Architectural adjustments  
- Fine-tuning and alignment strategies

## 💡 For End Users & Decision Makers

Move beyond marketing claims. The **Insights** tab provides empirical, task-relevant data to guide model selection:

- **Recommended Use Cases**  
  Match models to tasks based on observed performance.

- **Risk Profiles**  
  Visual indicators of where a model is likely to hallucinate or fail.

- **Application Guidance**  
  Examples:  
  - “Excellent for creative writing”  
  - “Avoid for mathematical or formal reasoning tasks”

## 📈 Understanding Scores

AIQ-X scores responses across four primary dimensions:

- **Length & Depth**  
  Rewards comprehensive, nuanced, and well-developed answers.

- **Uncertainty Calibration**  
  Rewards appropriate hedging and honesty about limitations.

- **Structure**  
  Evaluates logical organization and clarity of thought.

- **Domain-Specific Criteria**  
  Tailored scoring rules based on the subject area being tested.

> **Note:**  
> Low scores do not necessarily indicate poor quality overall. They often reflect a mismatch between a model’s response style and the evaluation criteria, which may vary in importance depending on your use case.

## 🎓 Domain Definitions

AIQ-X evaluates performance across **10 critical domains**:

1. **Logical Reasoning** – Decision theory, paradoxes, and complex logic  
2. **Mathematical Precision** – Operational accuracy and ambiguity handling  
3. **Epistemic Calibration** – Awareness of knowledge limits  
4. **Ethical Reasoning** – Navigating ethical dilemmas and frameworks  
5. **Creativity** – Novel ideas and innovative solutions  
6. **Robustness** – Edge-case handling and assumption stress-testing  
7. **Planning** – Multi-step reasoning with interdependent constraints  
8. **Meta-Cognition** – Self-awareness and limitation recognition  
9. **Instruction Compliance** – Strict adherence to explicit requirements  
10. **Communication Clarity** – Explaining complex topics to non-experts

## ⚙️ Data Management & Privacy

AIQ-X is designed with privacy and portability in mind:

- **Local Storage Only**  
  All evaluation data remains in your browser. Nothing is sent to external servers.

- **Export and Import**  
  Save and restore results as `.json` files for backup or external analysis.

- **Portability**  
  Move your results seamlessly across machines.
