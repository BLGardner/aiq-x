AIQ-X Professional Suite

An advanced benchmarking and diagnostic framework designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple dimensions of reasoning, precision, and reliability.
🎯 What's New in v4.0

    Multi-Tier Testing: Choose between Basic (10Q), Advanced (25Q), or Expert (40+Q) suites.

    Professional Diagnostics: In-depth analysis highlighting specific weaknesses and strengths.

    Adaptive Testing: Tiers now probe deeper based on real-time performance patterns.

    Actionable Insights: Direct guidance for both model trainers and end-users.

📊 Test Tiers Explained
Tier	Questions	Duration	Best For
Basic	10	2-5 mins	Quick comparisons and core capability checks.
Advanced	25	5-10 mins	Identifying common failure modes and depth analysis.
Expert	40+	10-20 mins	Stress tests, adversarial examples, and boundary cases.

    Recommendation: Start with the Basic tier to establish a baseline, then escalate to Advanced or Expert for rigorous evaluation.

🔬 For Model Trainers & Researchers

The Diagnostics tab identifies specific failure patterns to help guide your development cycle:

    Consistency Issues: Variance across similar prompts.

    Overconfidence Markers: Use of absolute language in uncertain contexts.

    Instruction Following: Failures in adhering to specific formatting or constraints.

    Reasoning Gaps: Logical inconsistencies within multi-step problems.

Reports include targeted suggestions for training data refinement, architectural adjustments, and fine-tuning strategies.
💡 For End Users & Decision Makers

Stop relying on marketing claims. The Insights tab provides empirical data to drive your model selection:

    Recommended Use Cases: Match models to tasks based on actual performance.

    Risk Profiles: Visual indicators of where a model is likely to hallucinate or fail.

    Application Guidance: e.g., "Excellent for creative writing; avoid for mathematical tasks."

📈 Understanding Scores

Scores are calculated across four primary dimensions:

    Length & Depth: Rewarding comprehensive and nuanced responses.

    Uncertainty Calibration: Rewarding appropriate "hedging" and honesty about limitations.

    Structure: Assessing logical organization and clarity of thought.

    Domain-Specific: Criteria tailored to the unique requirements of each subject.

Note: Low scores indicate a mismatch between the model's response style and the evaluation criteria, which may vary in importance depending on your specific use case.
🎓 Domain Definitions

AIQ-X evaluates models across these 10 critical domains:

    Logical Reasoning: Decision theory, paradoxes, and complex logic.

    Mathematical Precision: Operational accuracy and ambiguity handling.

    Epistemic Calibration: Awareness of knowledge limitations.

    Ethical Reasoning: Navigating ethical dilemmas and frameworks.

    Creativity: Innovative thinking and novel solution generation.

    Robustness: Edge case handling and challenging assumptions.

    Planning: Multi-step plans with interdependent constraints.

    Meta-Cognition: Self-awareness and identifying limitations.

    Instruction Compliance: Strict adherence to explicit requirements.

    Communication Clarity: Explaining complex topics to non-experts.

⚙️ Data Management & Privacy

    Local Storage: All evaluation data stays in your browser. Nothing is sent to external servers.

    Export/Import: Save results as .json for backup or external analysis.

    Data Reset: Easily clear browser data to reset the suite.

    Portability: Move your results across machines with ease.
