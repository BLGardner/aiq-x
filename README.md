AIQ-X Professional Suite Guide
🎯 What's New in v4.0
Multi-Tier Testing: Choose from Basic (10Q), Advanced (25Q), or Expert (40+Q) test suites.

Professional Diagnostics: Detailed analysis with specific weaknesses, strengths, and improvement recommendations.

Adaptive Testing: Advanced and Expert tiers probe deeper based on performance patterns.

Actionable Insights: Clear guidance for model trainers and best-fit application recommendations for users.
📊 Test Tiers Explained
Basic Tier (10 questions): Core capabilities assessment across all domains. Perfect for quick comparisons. Takes 2-5 minutes.

Advanced Tier (25 questions): Includes Basic plus 15 follow-up questions targeting common failure modes. Takes 5-10 minutes.

Expert Tier (40+ questions): Comprehensive with stress tests, adversarial examples, and boundary cases. Takes 10-20 minutes.

Start with Basic, then use Advanced/Expert for serious evaluation.
🔬 For Model Trainers & Researchers
The Diagnostics tab identifies specific failure patterns:
• Consistency issues (variance across similar questions)
• Overconfidence markers (absolute language)
• Instruction following failures
• Reasoning gaps and logical inconsistencies

Each report includes targeted improvement suggestions for training data, architecture, and fine-tuning strategies.
💡 For End Users & Decision Makers
The Insights tab shows recommended use cases based on actual test performance, not marketing claims.

Each model gets a risk profile indicating where it's likely to fail or provide unreliable outputs.

Clear recommendations like "Excellent for creative writing, avoid for mathematical tasks" based on empirical testing.
📈 Understanding Scores
Scores measure response quality across multiple dimensions:

• Length & Depth: Comprehensive responses score higher
• Uncertainty Calibration: Appropriate hedging is rewarded
• Structure: Logical organization and clear reasoning
• Domain-Specific: Each domain has tailored criteria

Scores indicate capability patterns. Low scores mean the model's response style doesn't match evaluation criteria, which may or may not matter for your use case.
